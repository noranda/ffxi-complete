# Step 6: Status Report

## Goal

Generate comprehensive status report confirming all quality gates have passed.

## Required Context

- ESLint check from Step 1 must have passed
- Test check from Step 2 must have passed
- TypeScript check from Step 3 must have passed
- Formatting check from Step 4 must have passed
- Markdown lint check from Step 5 must have passed

## Process

### 1. Collect Status Information

Since all previous steps have already validated their respective checks, collect the final status without re-running commands.

### 2. Status Information Collection

Gather specific metrics from each check:

1. **ESLint Results**:
   - Count of errors (should be 0)
   - Count of warnings (should be 0)
   - Confirmation of successful completion

2. **Test Results**:
   - Total number of test files
   - Total number of individual tests
   - Pass/fail counts
   - Success percentage (should be 100%)
   - Warning count (should be 0)

3. **TypeScript Results**:
   - Compilation status
   - Error count (should be 0)
   - Warning count (should be 0)
   - Confirmation of successful type checking

4. **Formatting Results**:
   - Number of files checked
   - Formatting compliance status
   - Confirmation all files use proper code style
   - Warning count (should be 0)

5. **Markdown Results**:
   - Number of markdown files checked
   - Error count (should be 0)
   - Warning count (should be 0)

### 3. Generate Single Status Report

Create one comprehensive status report using standardized format (do not repeat multiple times):

```markdown
## ✅ **Status Check**

🟢 **Lint**: 0 Errors, 0 Warnings  
🟢 **Tests**: [X]/[X] passing (100% success rate), 0 Warnings
🟢 **Types**: 0 Errors, 0 Warnings 
🟢 **Format**: All files properly formatted, 0 Warnings
🟢 **Markdown**: 0 Errors, 0 Warnings  

### Issues Found:
None - All quality gates passed ✅
```

### 4. Color Indicator Rules

Use appropriate color indicators based on results:

- 🟢 **Green**: Perfect status (0 errors, 0 warnings, 100% pass rate)
- 🟠 **Orange**: Warnings present but no errors
- 🔴 **Red**: Errors present (this should not occur if all previous steps passed)

### 5. Detailed Metrics

Include specific counts in the report:

- **Lint**: "0 Errors, 0 Warnings" (exact counts)
- **Tests**: "[actual]/[total] passing (percentage%), 0 Warnings (exact count)"
- **Types**: "0 Errors, 0 Warnings" or specific count
- **Format**: "All files properly formatted, 0 Warnings" or specific file counts
- **Markdown**: "0 Errors, 0 Warnings" (exact counts)

### 6. Additional Context

If any issues were found and fixed during the workflow:

```markdown
### Issues Resolved During Check:
- [Step X]: [Brief description of issues fixed]
- [Step Y]: [Brief description of issues fixed]

All issues have been successfully resolved ✅
```

## Expected Output

- Comprehensive status report with all green indicators
- Specific metrics showing 0 errors and 0 warnings across all checks
- Clear summary of workflow completion

## Success Criteria

All status indicators should be green (🟢) with:

- ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: 100% passing, 0 warnings
- TypeScript: 0 compilation errors, 0 warnings
- Formatting: All files properly formatted, 0 warnings
- Markdown: 0 errors, 0 warnings

## Workflow Execution Notes

**Important**: Do not re-run all quality checks in this step. Each previous step has already validated its respective
check. Simply generate the final status report based on the successful completion of steps 1-5.

## Workflow Completion

This is the final step of the check-status workflow. Upon completion:

- All quality gates have been validated
- Any issues found have been resolved
- Project is confirmed to be in a healthy state
- Development can proceed with confidence
- **Only one status report should be generated** (avoid redundant output)
