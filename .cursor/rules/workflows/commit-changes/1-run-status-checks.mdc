# Step 1: Run Status Checks

## Goal

Execute all project quality checks and verify that the codebase is in a healthy state before proceeding
with commit creation. All checks must pass green before moving to the next step.

## Required Context/Inputs

- None - this step runs standard project quality checks

## Process

1. **Run ESLint**: Execute `yarn lint` to check for linting issues
2. **Run Tests**: Execute `yarn test --run` to run all tests (using --run flag to avoid watch mode)
3. **Run Type Check**: Execute `yarn type-check` to verify TypeScript compilation
4. **Run Format Check**: Execute `yarn prettier --check .` to verify code formatting
5. **Run Markdown Lint**: Execute `yarn lint:md` to check markdown file formatting

## Quality Gate Requirements

All five checks must pass with exit code 0:

- ✅ **Lint Status**: No ESLint errors
- ✅ **Test Status**: All tests passing
- ✅ **Type Status**: No TypeScript compilation errors  
- ✅ **Format Status**: All files properly formatted
- ✅ **Markdown Status**: All markdown files follow style guidelines

## Expected Outputs

- Status report showing results of all five quality checks
- Clear indication if any checks failed (blocking progression)
- Green light to proceed to step 2 if all checks pass

## Instructions for AI

1. Run all five status check commands in parallel for efficiency
2. Report results using the standard status-check-reporting format with emoji indicators
3. If ANY check fails, stop the workflow and report the issues - do not proceed
4. Only if ALL checks pass, confirm readiness to proceed to step 2
5. Wait for explicit user approval before moving to next step

## Failure Handling

If any status check fails:

- Report the specific failures clearly
- Suggest fixes if obvious (lint auto-fix, format auto-fix)
- Do NOT proceed to step 2 until all issues are resolved
- User must fix issues and restart the workflow
