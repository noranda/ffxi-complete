# Cursor Workflows

## How Workflows Work

Workflows are sequential processes that guide the AI assistant through complex multi-step tasks. Each workflow
consists of numbered rule files that must be executed in order.

### Workflow Execution Rules

1. **Sequential Processing**: Execute files in numerical order (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **User Confirmation**: Stop after each step and wait for user approval to proceed
3. **Context Gathering**: Always ask for required context before starting each step
4. **No Assumptions**: Never assume missing information - always prompt the user
5. **Completion Summary**: After the final step, report what was accomplished and list all files created

### Triggering Workflows

When a user says something like "run the [workflow-name] workflow":

1. **Identify the workflow folder** (e.g., `feature-development`)
2. **Ask for initial context** needed for the first step
3. **Execute step 1** according to its rule file
4. **Stop and ask for permission** to proceed to step 2
5. **Repeat** until all numbered steps are complete
6. **Provide completion summary** with file list

### Available Workflows

- **feature-development**: 3-step process for creating PRDs, generating tasks, and managing implementation
- **commit-changes**: 4-step process for running status checks, analyzing changes, generating commit messages,
  and executing commits
- **check-status**: 6-step automated process for running comprehensive quality checks and fixing issues

## Example Usage

```text
User: "Run the feature-development workflow"
AI: "I'll run the feature-development workflow. This will guide us through creating a PRD, generating tasks, and managing implementation.

To start with step 1 (create-prd), I need to know:
- What feature would you like to create a PRD for?
- Do you have any initial requirements or ideas?"

User: [provides context]
AI: [executes step 1, creates PRD]
AI: "Step 1 complete! I've created the PRD. Ready to proceed to step 2 (generate-tasks)?"

User: "yes"
AI: [executes step 2]
... and so on
```

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow folder should contain:

- Numbered rule files (1-xxx.mdc, 2-xxx.mdc, etc.)
- Each file should specify:
  - Goal of the step
  - Required context/inputs
  - Process to follow
  - Expected outputs
  - Instructions for the AI
