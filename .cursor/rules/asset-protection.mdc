# Asset Protection Rules

## Critical Asset Protection System

This rule protects irreplaceable assets that represent significant manual work and time investment.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Assets

### FFXI Character Portraits
**Location**: `src/assets/portraits/`  
**Status**: 128 manually sorted character portraits  
**Protection Level**: CRITICAL - NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

#### Protected Files:
- All portrait files: `portrait-{race}-{gender}-face{1-8}-hair{A|B}.jpg`
- Directory structure: `src/assets/portraits/{race}/{gender}/`

#### Protection Requirements:
Before ANY operation affecting these files:
1. ‚úã **STOP** - Ask for explicit user permission
2. üìù Explain exactly what will happen  
3. üíæ Offer to create additional backups
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Never assume operations are "safe"

## üö® AI Agent Instructions

### CRITICAL PROTECTION PROTOCOLS

**NEVER** perform the following operations on protected assets without explicit user permission:
- Move, rename, or relocate files
- Delete or remove files
- Modify file contents
- Change directory structure
- Run scripts that might affect these files
- Perform bulk operations on these directories

### Required Actions Before Protected Asset Operations:
1. **Ask Permission First**: Always request explicit permission before any operation
2. **Explain Impact**: Clearly describe what will happen to the files
3. **Offer Backups**: Suggest creating additional backups
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Ensure user understands the risks
5. **Wait for Approval**: Never proceed without clear confirmation

### Emergency Recovery Information:
- **Manual Work**: These represent hours of manual classification and sorting
- **Irreplaceable**: Cannot be easily regenerated
- **Business Critical**: Essential for character creation functionality

## üîí Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Protected Assets:
When new critical assets need protection:
1. Add them to the "Protected Assets" section above
2. Specify the protection level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)
3. Define specific protection requirements
4. Update AI agent instructions if needed

### Protection Levels:
- **CRITICAL**: Never modify without explicit permission
- **HIGH**: Require permission and backup before modification  
- **MEDIUM**: Warn before modification, suggest backups

## üìã Asset Inventory

### Currently Protected:
- `src/assets/portraits/` - 128 FFXI character portraits (CRITICAL)

### Future Considerations:
- Database seed files
- Configuration files
- User data exports
- Other manually curated content
