# Rule Management Guidelines (Ultra-Condensed)

## Golden Rules & Evidence

- **All rule changes must be evidence-based:**  
  - Show need with examples, research, and rationale.
  - Test and document before publishing.
- **Manual verification first:**  
  - Tools validate, not replace, manual checks.
  - Always document what was and wasn't checked.
- **Never claim thoroughness or compliance** without showing your process and findings.

## Rule System Structure

- **Main rules:** `.cursor/rules/` (overviews, integration)
- **Fragments:** `.cursor/rules/fragments/` (single-purpose, < 300 lines)
- **Workflows:** `.cursor/workflows/` (step-by-step)

## Rule Creation & Updates

- **Create/update for:** New patterns, repeated decisions, complex processes, knowledge gaps, or quality issues.
- **Process:**  
  1. Place in correct folder, update lists, renumber as needed.
  2. Test in practice.
  3. Document rationale and evidence.

## Quality & Maintenance

- **Content:** Clear, actionable, current, and tested.
- **Structure:** Consistent, logical, easy to scan.
- **Length:** Keep rules concise and readable - say only what's needed.
- **Assessment:** Manual + tool validation, cross-reference checks.
- **Maintenance:** Regular review, evidence-driven updates.

## Every Change Must

- **Update code-guidelines assessment:**
  - What/why changed (before/after), manual/tool verification, edge cases, numbering.

## Every Fragment Must Have

- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata with description and globs
- **Clear title**: Descriptive heading
- **Focused content**: Single-purpose guidelines
- **Actionable guidance**: Specific, testable requirements

## Example Fragment

```markdown
---
description: "Brief description of what this fragment covers"
globs:
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.tsx"
---

# [Title]
## [Concept/Pattern]
### [Guideline]
- Principle, implementation, example, rationale
## [Secondary Concept]
## [Pitfalls/References]
```

**Summary:**  
Keep rules modular, evidence-driven, and easy to maintain. Every change must be justified, tested, and
clearly documented. Always show your work.
