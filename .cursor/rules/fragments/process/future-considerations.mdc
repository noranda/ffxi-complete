# Future Considerations

## Scalability Planning

- **Multi-character support** - Design data structures for multiple characters per user
- **Community features** - Plan for sharing and collaboration functionality
- **Internationalization** - Consider localization framework early
- **Mobile development** - Prepare responsive design for mobile app transition

## Integration Opportunities

- **Windower addon** integration for real-time data sync
- **EliteAPI** integration for game state monitoring
- **Export/import** functionality for data portability
- **Community data sharing** for collaborative tracking

## Monitoring & Analytics

- **Error tracking** (Sentry) for production issue monitoring
- **Performance monitoring** for database and frontend optimization
- **Privacy-focused analytics** for user behavior insights
- **Database metrics** for query performance optimization

## Implementation Approach

- **Design with flexibility** - avoid hard-coding assumptions
- **Plan integration points** - define clear API boundaries
- **Document decisions** - capture reasoning for future reference
- **Incremental adoption** - implement features progressively
