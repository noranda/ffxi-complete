# UI/UX Guidelines

## Design Philosophy

Collection-focused design inspired by XIV-Complete, emphasizing:
- **Clean organization** with visual progress indicators
- **Quick navigation** between tracking categories
- **Efficient workflows** for completionist players

## Core Patterns

### Tab-Based Navigation
- Horizontal tabs with progress indicators (`Jobs 15/22`)
- Clear active state distinction
- Responsive: stack/scroll on mobile
- Quick switching between collections

### Collection Lists
- Vertical list structure with consistent spacing
- Row-based items with hover effects
- Expandable sections using accordion pattern
- Visual state indicators (completed/in-progress/not started)

### Progress Indicators
- Circular progress for completion percentages
- Badge counters showing ratios (15/22)
- Color coding: Green (complete), Blue (in-progress), Gray (not started)
- Progress bars for levels/experience

## Responsive Design

### Desktop (1024px+)
- Full tab navigation with progress
- Multi-column layouts
- Hover states and keyboard shortcuts

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Bottom navigation or hamburger menu
- Single column layout
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures for navigation

## Accessibility (Required)

### Keyboard Navigation
- Logical tab order
- Enter/Space for activation
- Arrow keys for lists
- Escape to close modals
- Visible focus indicators

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for complex interactions
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images/icons

### Visual Accessibility
- Color contrast minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Highly visible focus indicators
- No color-only information
- Scalable text up to 200%
- Respect reduced motion preferences

## Theme System

### Colors
- **Dark theme primary** with light option
- **Progress**: Green (complete), Blue (in-progress), Gray (not started)
- **Semantic**: Success, warning, error states
- **Brand colors** reflecting FFXI aesthetic

### Typography
- Clear hierarchy with consistent sizing
- Readable fonts optimized for data display
- Monospace for numerical data
- Proper line spacing for scanning

### Spacing
- Consistent scale: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px
- Grid system for alignment
- White space to prevent overload
- Visual grouping through proximity

## Best Practices

- **Optimistic updates** for immediate feedback
- **Loading states** during operations
- **Error handling** with clear messaging
- **Touch-friendly** interactions on mobile
- **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large lists
