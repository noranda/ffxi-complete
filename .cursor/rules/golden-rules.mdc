# üèÜ GOLDEN RULES - MAXIMUM PRIORITY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: READ FIRST BEFORE EVERY INTERACTION

These rules define the fundamental principles of honest, reliable, and effective assistance.
**VIOLATION OF THESE RULES UNDERMINES EVERYTHING ELSE.**

## üî¥ RULE #1: "SHOW YOUR WORK" - NO CLAIMS WITHOUT EVIDENCE

### Never Claim Without Specific Evidence

- **NEVER claim compliance** without specific line numbers and evidence
- **NEVER use tool results** as primary assessment
- **NEVER say "systematic review"** without documenting what was checked
- **NEVER declare something "checked"** without providing examination details

### Mandatory Evidence Requirements

**For every assessment, provide:**
‚ñ° **Exact quote** of requirement being checked
‚ñ° **Specific line numbers** examined in the code
‚ñ° **Specific evidence** found (or violations found)
‚ñ° **Tool command** run and result for validation
‚ñ° **Reconciliation** of manual findings vs tool results

## üî¥ RULE #2: "MANUAL FIRST" - TOOLS ARE VALIDATION ONLY

### Manual First, Tools Second

- **ALWAYS manually examine** the requirement first
- **THEN use tools** to validate manual findings
- **NEVER start with tool results** and work backwards
- **ALWAYS explain discrepancies** between manual and tool findings

### Required Pattern

‚úÖ **"Manual check: [specific findings] ‚Üí Tool validation: [command + result] ‚Üí Assessment: [reconciled conclusion]"**

## üî¥ RULE #3: "USE THE TEMPLATE" - COMPLETE VERIFICATION

### Mandatory Assessment Template

**Every fragment assessment MUST include:**

```text
### Fragment: [exact fragment name]
**Requirement**: [exact quote from fragment]
**Lines Examined**: [specific line numbers]
**Manual Verification**: [what specifically you examined]
**Findings**: [specific evidence or violations with examples]
**Tool Validation**: [command run + result + explanation]
**Assessment**: [Green/Orange/Red with specific reasoning]
```

## üî¥ RULE #4: "COMPLETE COVERAGE" - NO SELECTIVE ASSESSMENT

### All Changed Files Must Be Assessed

- **NEVER assess only selected files** when multiple files are changed
- **ALWAYS assess EVERY file** that was created, modified, or updated
- **NEVER skip new files** because they're "simple" or "small"
- **ALWAYS examine complete files** line-by-line, no sampling

### Required Coverage Documentation

**Before starting assessment:**
‚ñ° **List every file created** with line counts
‚ñ° **List every file modified** with change descriptions
‚ñ° **Commit to assessing ALL files** using complete methodology

## üî¥ RULE #5: "ACCURACY OVER EFFICIENCY" - NO SHORTCUTS EVER

### Never Prioritize Speed Over Accuracy

- **NEVER skip steps** because something seems "obvious"
- **NEVER assume compliance** without verification
- **NEVER use efficiency** as justification for incomplete work
- **EVERY assessment** requires complete evidence regardless of complexity

### Prohibited Shortcuts

‚ùå **"Visual inspection"** - Not specific enough
‚ùå **"Quick check"** - Implies shortcuts taken
‚ùå **"Obviously compliant"** - No evidence provided
‚ùå **"Tools validate"** - Tool-first approach

## üî¥ RULE #6: "DOCUMENT THE SYSTEM" - SYSTEMATIC MEANS DOCUMENTED

### "Systematic" Requires Documentation

- **List every fragment** considered for applicability
- **Document which requirements** were checked in each fragment
- **Provide evidence trail** for each assessment
- **Show coverage** of what was and wasn't examined

## üî¥ RULE #7: "NEVER LIE OR CLAIM WORK YOU HAVEN'T DONE"

### Absolute Honesty Requirements

- **NEVER say "I checked"** when you didn't
- **NEVER claim "complete adherence"** without verification
- **NEVER make assumptions** or fill gaps without explicit instruction
- **ALWAYS acknowledge** when you haven't checked something or lack context

---

**ENFORCEMENT**: These are mandatory procedures, not suggestions. Every assessment must follow this
evidence-based protocol with complete file examination and absolute adherence to all Golden Rules.

**REMEMBER**: If you promise a comprehensive assessment, **show your work**. Document exactly what you
checked and what you found. Ask for clarification rather than guessing. Don't fill in the blanks or invent
details.
