# FFXI Progress Tracker ‚Äì PRD

## üìå Objective

Build a React-based web app that helps Final Fantasy XI players track their character progress across multiple
domains (jobs, spells, items, quests, etc.) with a persistent backend and potential for community collaboration. The
tool will support both manual tracking and preloaded game data, with future goals of automated character syncing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 + shadcn + Radix
- **Routing**: react-router-dom with deep linking for collections
- **State Management**: React Context with collection-focused patterns
- **Testing**: React Testing Library
- **Storage**: Persistent (no localStorage-only solutions)
- **Design Pattern**: Collection-focused UI inspired by XIV-Complete with tab navigation, accordion lists, and progress indicators

### Backend (MVP Recommendation)

- **Stack**: Supabase
- **Database**: Postgres
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (with email or Discord OAuth)
- Realtime sync, row-level security, and RESTful/GraphQL APIs
- Community-supported and frontend-friendly
- **Bonus**: Easily self-hostable later if needed
- **Versioning**: Changesets for data updates (e.g. new quests or items)

### Design Approach

The application follows a **collection-focused design pattern** inspired by [XIV-Complete](https://xiv-complete.com/), prioritizing:

- **Tab-based navigation** with progress indicators for each collection type
- **Vertical list layouts** with accordion expansion for detailed information
- **Prominent search and filtering** at the top of each collection
- **Visual progress indicators** throughout (completion ratios, progress bars, badges)
- **Clean, dark theme** optimized for data scanning and completionist workflows
- **Consistent interaction patterns** across all collection types
- **Responsive design** that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

This approach emphasizes **usability over complexity**, making it easy for players to quickly navigate between
different tracking categories, see their progress at a glance, and efficiently manage their completion goals.

### Data Sources

| Type                    | Source                         | Method                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Items, Spells, Trusts   | Windower resources/ repo       | Preprocessed JSON via script      |
| Quests, Missions, BLU   | BGWiki / FFXIclopedia          | Scraped or semi-manual data dumps |
| Extended item stats     | LandSandBoat SQL (optional)    | Future enrichment layer           |
| Character sync (future) | Windower Lua addon or EliteAPI | Optional upload/export            |

## üöÄ Development Workflow Breakdown

### Foundation Phase (MVP Core)

#### 1. Project Setup & Infrastructure

**Prompt**: "Create a foundational project setup for the FFXI Progress Tracker with Vite, React 19, TypeScript,
TailwindCSS v4, shadcn/ui, and Supabase integration. Include authentication, basic routing, and a clean project
structure following our code guidelines. Design the layout with a collection-focused approach inspired by
XIV-Complete: tab-based navigation at the top, progress indicators in tabs, and a dark theme with clean typography."

#### 2. Authentication & User Management

**Prompt**: "Build a complete authentication system for FFXI Progress Tracker using Supabase Auth with email/password
and Discord OAuth options. Include login, registration, password reset, and protected route functionality with proper
error handling."

#### 3. Character Management System

**Prompt**: "Create a character management system that allows users to create, edit, and select multiple FFXI
characters. Each character should have a name, server, and be linked to the authenticated user with proper data
persistence in Supabase."

### Core Tracking Phase (MVP Features)

#### 4. Jobs Tracking System

**Prompt**: "Build a comprehensive job tracking system for all FFXI jobs using the XIV-Complete design pattern.
Create a 'Jobs' tab with progress indicator (e.g., 'Jobs 15/22'), display jobs in a vertical list with accordion
expansion, include level input fields with progress bars, job icons, and search/filter functionality. Focus on clean,
scannable layout with completion states clearly visible."

#### 5. Crafts Tracking System

**Prompt**: "Create a crafting skills tracking system that allows users to track levels and ranks for all FFXI
crafting disciplines. Include level tracking (1-110+), rank progression, and skill point management with visual
progress indicators."

#### 6. Trusts Collection Tracker

**Prompt**: "Build a Trusts collection tracker following the XIV-Complete collection pattern. Create a 'Trusts' tab
with completion counter (e.g., 'Trusts 142/287'), display trusts in a vertical list with checkbox interactions,
include search bar and quick filters (All/Acquired/Unacquired), trust icons, and accordion expansion for detailed
info. Emphasize satisfying completion feedback and clear visual progress indicators."

### Enhanced Features Phase

tracking (0-500+), skill categories, progress visualization, and the ability to set skill level goals per character."

#### 8. Fame Tracking System

**Prompt**: "Build a fame tracking system for all FFXI regions and areas. Allow users to track fame levels (1-9)
across different regions, display fame requirements for unlocks, and show overall fame progression."

#### 9. BLU Spells Collection Manager

**Prompt**: "Create a Blue Mage spell collection tracker that displays all learnable spells with detailed information
including spell effects, learning methods, monster sources, and location data. Include search, filtering, and spell
set management features."

### Advanced Features Phase
